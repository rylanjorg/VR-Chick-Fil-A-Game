The included unity file uses the Universal render pipeline. There should not be any issues upon installation, but it may require that materials be reimported/updated to URP. 
Furthermore, you may have to add the URP asset in the project seettings.

For building the project, select the Menu, Kitchen, and JesusOutside scene and order them as the following in the build menu: Menu, Outside, Kitchen. 
If ordered incorrectly, the scene transitions may not work. Furthermore, when transitioning scenes there is sometimes a lighting issue where 
the scene appears much darker than it should. If this error occurs, it is reccommended to build and run each scene individually. 

The project runs on Unity 2021.3.9f1
